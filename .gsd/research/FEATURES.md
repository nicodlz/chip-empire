## 📊 Table Stakes (Must Have or Players Leave)

These features are **non-negotiable**. Every successful idle game has them.

### 1. Core Click Loop
- **Manual clicking** as the initial interaction (1 resource per click to start)
- Immediate, satisfying feedback on every click
- Visual/audio feedback for clicking (numbers flying, sounds, particles)
- Cookie Clicker: Click cookie → get cookie. Universally understood.

### 2. Automation (Idle Production)
- **Passive income generators** that work without clicking
- Production continues when the app is closed (offline progress)
- Multiple tiers of automation (cursors → grandmas → factories)
- AdVenture Capitalist: Managers run businesses automatically

### 3. Upgrades System
- **Permanent upgrades** that multiply production
- Clear progression path with visible next goals
- Upgrades for both active (click power) and passive (idle speed)
- Exponential cost scaling (typically 15-20% per purchase)

### 4. Prestige/Reset Mechanic
- **Soft reset** that trades progress for permanent bonuses
- "Prestige currency" (Hero Souls, Heavenly Chips, Angel Investors)
- Makes the game infinitely replayable
- Universal Paperclips: New Universe option after completion
- Cookie Clicker: Ascension with Heavenly Chips (+1% per level)

### 5. Number Visualization
- **Big number notation** (scientific, suffixes like M, B, T, Qa, Qi...)
- Satisfying number growth animations
- Clear display of production rates (per second/minute)
- Antimatter Dimensions: Numbers reaching 10^308 and beyond

### 6. Offline Progress
- **Accumulation while away** (essential for mobile)
- "Welcome back! You earned X while away"
- Reasonable caps or diminishing returns to encourage return visits

### 7. Save System
- **Auto-save** frequently
- Cloud save / cross-device sync (for mobile)
- Export/import saves (hardcore players demand this)

### 8. Clear Goals & Milestones
- **Visible next unlock** always on screen
- Progress bars toward next achievement/upgrade
- "You need X more to unlock Y"

- Wiki-worthy depth (players WANT to document and discuss)
- Share-worthy moments ("I finally reached X!")
- Leaderboards or competitive elements (optional)

### 7. Art & Sound Identity
- **Cookie Clicker**: C418 composed the Steam soundtrack
- Memorable visual style (doesn't need to be complex)
- Satisfying sound design for clicks and milestones
- Visual evolution as player progresses

### 8. Events & Seasonal Content
- **AdVenture Capitalist**: Limited-time holiday events

- Reason to return periodically
- FOMO without being predatory

### 3. Excessive Complexity Too Early

### 6. Pure RNG Progression
